    <p> 
        Yam pottage/porridge with is locally known as <b>Asaro</b> is a very delicious Yam recipe though 
        it’s eaten by most tribes in Nigeria however, it is more common in the Yoruba-speaking parts of Nigeria. 
        Yam pottage/porridge is soft and it tastes so good with the combination of ingredients.
        It’s also very easy to make. If you love <strong>YAM</strong>, it’s a must-try recipe!
    </p>

    <p>
        Asaro is made from <u><b>Puna Yam</b></u> which is boiled till it’s tender and it’s cooked in a blend of Peppers,
         Tomatoes, onions, palm oil, and seasoning. While the dish is more common in the Yoruba-speaking region 
         of Nigeria, it is still a meal enjoyed by the majority alike each with their own regional variation.

        It is nicknamed <i><strong>“Asaro elepo rede rede”</strong></i> meaning yam porridge boldly colored with fresh
         palm oil and garnished to perfection.

        <h3>Instructions/Steps/Methods:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and cut the Yam into medium-sized chunks. Rinse a couple of times until the water is no longer cloudy. Set aside</li>
            <li>Blend the bell pepper, habanero, tomato, and half onion.</li>
            <li>Put the yams inside a pot, and add the blended sauce, salt, bouillon powder, and water. Cover and let it cook for 10 minutes on medium to high heat</li>

            <li>Mash the yams with a potato masher or a wooden spoon. I love to mash some yams and keep some chunks. It gives more texture!</li>

            <li>Allow it to simmer for an additional 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
